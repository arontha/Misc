# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Training
#### By Aron Tharp

### Abstract:
A very simple exploration in training an AI based on many simulations, starting with a purely random AI and improving iteratively.

### Summary:
As a proof of concept, I developed an AI to play the classic game of tic-tac-toe. To train the AI, I begin with a purely random AI (choose where to play an x or o randomly). I then make the random AIs play against each other millions of times and record the outcomes to develop a smarter AI. Then, a final iteration of training takes place where the smarter AI plays against itself 150,000 times, and then also plays against the random AI millions of times each first as x and then as o. These three AIs can then be played against by an individual as easy, medium, or hard difficulty, respectively.

### Contents:
**1. Tic-Tac-Toe.ipynb**
- Play the game as a player against the 3 AIs
- Requires the x_wins, o_wins, and ties directories with their contents

**2. Tic-Tac-Toe_Trainer_First_Iteration.ipynb**
- Make the random AI play against itself millions of times
- Generates the first set of data for the ‘smarter’ AI aka medium difficulty

**3. Tic-Tac-Toe_Trainer_Second_Iteration.ipynb**
- Make the smarter AI play against itself and the random AI hundreds of thousands of times
- Generates the second set of data for the even smarter AI aka hard difficulty

**4. x_wins, o_wins, and ties directories**
- each directory contains the results of the 2 trainings saved as x_wins, o_wins, and ties .txt files

### Failures and Successes:
Initiatially, the random AI was truly 'random', meaning even if a move was available to immediately win the game, the AI would not take it. Despite this naiveté, the AI still performed decently, about as well as a school child, but it could not compete with a smart human adult tic-tac-toe player and would still lose. As a result, the ranadom AI needed a slight logic boost, and the random play now also evaluates if any immediately moves win the game, and takes the winning move instead of the random move if available. 

### "Smart" AI
The way the Smart AI uses the data is as follows:
1. If an immediate move wins, take it.
2. If an immediate move ties, take it.
